# This Project is basic Implementation of Decentralized Autonomus Orginizations (created using Openzeppelin).
In this project I have Implemented a basic DAO in which the members of DAO:

    1. Can Vote for a perticular proposal
    2. Can Propose a change.
When a perticular change is proposed:

    1. There will be voting period where members of the DAO can vote againt or in favour of a proposal.
    2. If majority vote against the proposal it gets cancelled.

If the propopsal is successfull 

    1. It will by default get queued for certain amount of time before getting implemented give unsatisfied members time to leave.
    2. After waiting period is over anyon can execute a perticalur change.
